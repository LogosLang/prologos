### §5.P5 — Ruling B + factoring

**Intent**: upgrade the strict waypoint to Ruling B — B2 keywise node merge ·
B3 same-spine pointwise merge (spine = source-directed steps with
`^`-continuations erased; Q7's residuals settle here) · L2 factoring
(`{p:a p:b} → p:{a b}`) as the normal form, with **error messages printing
the factored spelling** (spec: SHOULD) · L3 assoc/comm on disjoint keys ·
Q6 (idempotent self-merge) ruled here.

**Test delta**: corpus §10.3 uncomments; L1–L5 law tests as a dedicated
battery (the equational theory IS test material). Status: ⬜.
