# Grammar Form — Design Thinking (Revised Draft)

**Date**: 2026-04-03 (revised 2026-04-04)
**Stage**: 2 (Design thinking — converging on direction)
**Series**: PPN Track 3.5 / Grammar Form R&D
**Status**: Living document. Captures design direction from discussion. Not yet a Stage 3 formal design.

**Research grounding**:
- [Grammar Toplevel Form — Vision](../research/2026-03-26_GRAMMAR_TOPLEVEL_FORM.md) — 7-view multi-spec, progressive specification
- [Self-Describing Serialization](../research/2026-03-25_SELF_DESCRIBING_SERIALIZATION_GRAMMAR.md) — grammar as serialization spec, duality, invariant levels
- [Hypergraph Rewriting](../research/2026-03-24_HYPERGRAPH_REWRITING_PROPAGATOR_PARSING.md) — Engelfriet-Heyker, HR grammars = attribute grammars
- [Adhesive Categories](../research/2026-04-03_ADHESIVE_CATEGORIES_PARSE_TREES.md) — parse trees are adhesive presheaves, DPO toolkit, CALM connection
- [Kan Extensions / ATMS / GFP](../research/2026-03-26_KAN_EXTENSIONS_ATMS_GFP_PARSING.md) — demand-driven parsing, disambiguation
- [Lattice Foundations for PPN](../research/2026-03-26_LATTICE_FOUNDATIONS_PPN.md) — 6-domain reduced product, type-lattice semiring
- [Tropical Optimization](../research/2026-03-24_TROPICAL_OPTIMIZATION_NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md) — cost-weighted rewriting, lossy grammars

**Implementation grounding**:
- [SRE Track 2D](2026-04-03_SRE_TRACK2D_DESIGN.md) — DPO spans, pattern-desc, child-pattern-split, fold/tree combinators, propagator factory, critical pair analysis. 13 rules, 0 critical pairs. The compilation target.
- [SRE Track 2H](2026-04-02_SRE_TRACK2H_DESIGN.md) — type-lattice quantale, tensor, pseudo-complement. The type-level foundation.
- Existing `defmacro` in macros.rkt — pattern→template surface rewriting
- Existing precedence DAG in macros.rkt — `prec-group` with `tighter-than` DAG, `op-info` with computed binding powers

---

## 1. The Goal

A `grammar` toplevel form that is:
- **The universal extension mechanism** — powerful enough that language implementors would use it for most of their own needs
- **Progressive** — a one-liner for sugar, a full spec for real language extensions (Progressive Disclosure)
- **Subsumes `defmacro`** — the simplest `grammar` form IS a defmacro. Eventually deprecates `defmacro`.
- **Multi-view** — a grammar production simultaneously specifies parsing, serialization, types, reduction, display. Each view is a DPO span on a different lattice domain.
- **Bidirectional where possible** — parsing and serialization are duals. The grammar declares invariant level. `:dual` can be inferred but is worth asserting for compiler verification.
- **Compositional** — grammar productions reference other productions by name. Repetition, optionality, and alternation as production-level combinators.
- **First-class** — grammar rules are values. They compose. They export from modules. They participate in the SRE as registered DPO spans.
- **Checked** — critical pair analysis at registration. Type rules validated. Invariant levels checked.
- **Context-sensitive capable** — productions can read from context cells (indentation, scope). Mechanically safe via propagator architecture. An experimental extension.

---

## 2. The Multi-Domain View

Each view of a `grammar` production is a DPO span on a different lattice domain in the 6-domain reduced product:

| View | Domain | DPO direction | What it specifies |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| `:lex` | Token lattice (L_token) | Characters → tokens | How to TOKENIZE this form |
| `:parse` | Surface lattice (L_surface) | Tokens/trees → tree | How to PARSE this form |
| `:type` | Type lattice (L_type) | Surface form → constraints | What TYPE this form has (optional — inferred from `:target` when present) |
| `:reduce` | Core lattice (L_core) | Redex → contractum | How this form EVALUATES |
| `:display` | Text lattice | Tree → text | How to DISPLAY this form (derived from `:parse` when lossless) |
| `:serialize` | Byte lattice | Tree → bytes | How to ENCODE this form for wire/storage |
| `:target` | Cross-domain | Parse result → structural target | The DESUGARING or COMPILATION of this form |

Not all views are required. Progressive specification: provide what you have, derive what you don't.

---

## 3. Progressive Specification

### Level 0: Sugar (replaces `defmacro`)

```prologos
grammar when
  | "when" cond:expr body:expr -> (if cond body unit)
```

One line. Pattern left, desugared form right. All other views derived from the target (`if`). This IS `defmacro` — same power, same conciseness.

### Level 1: Typed sugar

```prologos
grammar when
  | "when" cond:expr body:expr -> (if cond body unit) : A
```

Type annotation optional — if `if` has a spec, the compiler infers `cond : Bool` and `body : A → result : A` from the target's spec. Explicit types are self-documenting; compiler verifies consistency.

### Level 2: With reduction rules

```prologos
grammar when
  :parse  "when" cond:expr body:expr
  :target (if cond body unit)
  :reduce
    | when true  body -> body
    | when false _    -> unit
```

`:reduce` clauses compile to Track 6 DPO reduction rules. Same mechanism as β/δ/ι — one infrastructure, not two. Completeness principle.

### Level 3: Full multi-view

```prologos
grammar when
  :parse      "when" cond:expr body:expr
  :target     (if cond body unit)
  :type       cond : Bool, body : A -> A     ;; optional: inferred from target spec
  :reduce
    | when true  body -> body
    | when false _    -> unit
  :components [cond : Bool, body : A]         ;; SRE structural form
  :display    "when" cond body
  :invariant  value                           ;; lossy: can't reconstruct "when" from "if"
```

### Level 4: Serialization / wire protocol

```prologos
grammar json-number
  :lex        "0" | nonzero-digit digit* ("." digit+)?
  :target     [string-to-rat value]
  :serialize  [rat-to-decimal-string value]
  :invariant  structural
  :dual                                       ;; assertion: parse and serialize are inverses
```

`:dual` can be inferred (if `deserialize(serialize(x)) = x` at the declared invariant level). Explicit `:dual` is a DECLARATION the compiler CHECKS — same pattern as `check` in the type system. When `:serialize` is absent, `:dual` tells the compiler to derive it from `:lex`/`:parse`.

---

## 4. Type Information: `:target` Carries the Types

The `:target` expression carries all typing information via the target function's spec:

```prologos
grammar set-union
  :parse    a "∪" b
  :group    set-ops
  :target   [set-union a b]
  ;; Type inferred: set-union has spec Set<A> Set<A> -> Set<A>
  ;; Therefore a : Set<A>, b : Set<A>, result : Set<A>
```

Type annotations on `:parse` are **optional documentation** — verified by the compiler but carrying no new information beyond what `:target`'s spec already declares.

The `:type` view is only REQUIRED when there is no `:target` — i.e., for primitive forms that don't desugar to existing infrastructure:

```prologos
;; Primitive form: no desugaring target, must declare types
grammar my-primitive
  :parse  "prim" x:expr y:expr
  :type   x : Int, y : Int -> Bool    ;; required — no target to infer from
  :reduce
    | prim x y -> [int-lt x y]
```

Progressive disclosure: `:target` present → types inferred. `:target` absent → `:type` required.

---

## 5. Compositional Grammar Layering

Grammar productions COMPOSE by name reference. The grammar IS a set of mutually-referencing productions. Repetition (`+`, `*`, `?`) as production-level combinators.

### The Hierarchy

| Level | Syntax | What it matches | Example |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Character class | `/.../` | Raw characters (regex) | `/[0-9]/`, `/[a-zA-Z_]/` |
| Lexer production | name (in `:lex`) | Token by production | `digit`, `hex-digit` |
| Repetition | `name+`, `name*`, `name?` | Repeated production | `digit+`, `ident?` |
| Alternation | `a \| b` | Either production | `digit \| letter` |
| Literal token | `"..."` | Exact token string | `"when"`, `"+"`, `"("` |
| Tree nonterminal | `name` or `name:Type` | Parsed subtree | `cond:expr`, `a:Set<A>` |
| Separator pattern | `elem "sep" ...` | Separated sequence | `a:expr "," b:expr` |

### Syntactic Domain Inference

The domain is inferred from the syntactic form of each element — no modal prefix needed:

- **Quoted strings** (`"when"`, `"+"`) → token literal match
- **Bare names** (`cond`, `body`, `expr`) → tree nonterminal reference
- **Typed names** (`a:Set<A>`) → tree nonterminal with type constraint
- **Regex** (`/[0-9]/`) → character-level match (only in `:lex`)
- **Repetition** (`digit+`, `expr*`) → production combinator (works in both domains)

The compiler verifies: nonterminals must resolve to defined productions (or built-ins). Regex only appears in `:lex`. Type constraints verified against target spec.

### Composition Examples

```prologos
;; Lexer productions compose
grammar digit
  :lex /[0-9]/

grammar hex-digit
  :lex digit | /[a-fA-F]/

grammar hex-literal
  :lex "0x" hex-digit+
  :target [string-to-int value 16]

;; Parser productions compose
grammar expr
  | atom
  | "(" expr ")"
  | expr "+" expr   :group additive

grammar stmt
  | expr
  | "let" name:ident ":=" value:expr body:stmt
```

---

## 6. Operator Declarations via DAG-Based Precedence Groups

Operators use the existing DAG-based precedence system — NOT numeric precedence. Precedence groups declare `tighter-than` relations:

```prologos
;; Define a precedence group in the DAG
precedence-group set-ops
  :associativity left
  :tighter-than comparison

;; Operators reference their group
grammar set-union
  :parse    a "∪" b
  :group    set-ops
  :target   [set-union a b]

grammar set-intersect
  :parse    a "∩" b
  :group    set-ops
  :target   [set-intersect a b]
```

The DAG determines resolution order in the mixfix Pocket Universe (Track 2B). New groups extend the DAG. Groups that are UNRELATED in the DAG (neither tighter-than the other) require explicit disambiguation — the compiler warns at definition time.

The `grammar` form with `:group` compiles to the same `prec-group` + `op-info` registration that the existing mixfix system uses. No new mechanism — same infrastructure, surface syntax.

Critical pair analysis applies: operators in the same group with the same associativity → no critical pair. Operators in unrelated groups → require parenthesization.

---

## 7. Duality and Modality

### Invariant Levels

| Invariant | Round-trip guarantee | Example | Can be `:dual`? |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|-----------------|
| `:identity` | `eq?` preserved | In-process snapshot | ✅ Full |
| `:structural` | `equal?` preserved | .pnet cache, JSON | ✅ Full |
| `:behavioral` | Function behavior preserved | FFI re-link | ⚠️ Partial |
| `:value` | Computed value preserved | `when → if` desugar | ❌ One-directional |

### `:dual` as Assertion

`:dual` declares that `:parse` and `:serialize` (or `:display`) are inverses at the declared invariant level. The compiler verifies this structurally. When `:serialize` is absent, `:dual` tells the compiler to DERIVE it from the parse direction.

`:dual` CAN be inferred — but explicit assertion is worth keeping for the same reason `check` exists in the type system: the user says "I believe this property holds" and the compiler verifies.

### Serialization Connection

A `grammar` production with `:serialize` IS a serialization spec. The self-describing format (research §5) is a collection of `grammar` forms shipped with the data. The `.pnet` Part 1 grammar rules = `grammar` forms.

---

## 8. Context-Sensitive Grammar (Experimental)

Context-sensitivity via `:context` declaration — the production reads from a context cell on the network:

```prologos
grammar indented-block
  :parse    indent-open body:stmt* indent-close
  :context  indent-level : Nat
  :target   [block body]
```

The `:context` declaration says: this production's propagator reads from the `indent-level` cell. It only fires when the context cell has a value.

Mechanically SAFE: context is a lattice domain, the propagator reads it monotonically, the ATMS manages branching when context creates ambiguity. Adhesive DPO guarantees hold — context-sensitive productions compose with the same guarantees as context-free ones.

Conceptually EXPERIMENTAL: user-defined context-sensitivity is powerful but could create confusing syntax. Worth exploring — if it proves too complex for practical use, we can restrict it. The propagator architecture contains the power.

---

## 9. Module Export and Composition

Grammar extensions travel with modules:

```prologos
ns my-dsl

grammar my-form
  :parse  "my" x:expr
  :target [process x]
  :export                     ;; visible to importers
```

Importing a module that exports grammar extensions automatically registers those productions in the importer's grammar. Fully-qualified namespaces prevent collisions. Critical pair analysis runs at import time to verify composition safety.

Grammar rules are part of the module's exported interface — same as type definitions (`data`), trait implementations (`impl`), and function specs (`spec`).

---

## 10. Parameterized Grammars

Grammar productions parameterized by types:

```prologos
grammar list-literal {A : Type}
  :parse    "[" a:A ("," a:A)* "]"
  :target   List A
```

The type parameter determines how to parse elements. This uses existing HKT infrastructure — the grammar is a type-level function. The parse production is a generic function on the type lattice.

Connects to Track 2H's quantale: the type-lattice tensor distributes over union-typed parameters. A `list-literal {Int | String}` parses elements that are either Int or String expressions.

---

## 11. Compilation Target: Track 2D DPO Spans

The `grammar` form COMPILES TO Track 2D's DPO span infrastructure:

| Grammar feature | Track 2D mechanism |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `:parse` pattern | `pattern-desc` with child-patterns, literals, variadic |
| `:parse` separator patterns | `child-pattern-split` |
| `:parse` repetition (`+`, `*`) | Fold combinator (right-fold over repeated elements) |
| `:parse` → `:target` rewrite | `sre-rewrite-rule` with template RHS |
| `:group` operator | Registration in `prec-group` DAG + mixfix PU |
| `:reduce` clauses | DPO spans on core domain (Track 6 when available) |
| `:lex` patterns | Token-level DPO spans (PPN Track 1 domain) |
| Critical pair detection | `find-critical-pairs` at registration time |
| Confluence verification | `analyze-confluence` on the full rule set |
| Template instantiation | `instantiate-template` with `$punify-hole` markers |

The compilation is: parse the `grammar` form → generate `sre-rewrite-rule` registrations → verify via `verify-rewrite-rule` + `find-critical-pairs`.

---

## 12. Adhesive Category Guarantees

From the [adhesive categories research](../research/2026-04-03_ADHESIVE_CATEGORIES_PARSE_TREES.md):

- **Grammar extensions compose correctly** — concurrency theorem
- **Conflicts are detectable** — critical pair lemma completeness
- **Parallel parsing is safe** — parallelism theorem
- **CALM-compliant** — monotone grammar propagators are coordination-free

These apply to USER-DEFINED extensions. When a user writes `grammar my-form`, the compiler verifies adhesive safety before accepting it.

---

## 13. Resolved Design Decisions

| Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| `defmacro` relationship | `grammar` subsumes; `defmacro` eventually deprecated | Level 0 grammar IS defmacro. No rush — deprecate when grammar is proven. |
| Numeric vs DAG precedence | DAG with `tighter-than` (existing design) | Extensible, intuitive, no "what number?" problem. |
| Type information source | `:target` carries types; `:type` optional/required when no target | Progressive disclosure. Most grammars have targets. |
| `:reduce` mechanism | Compiles to Track 6 DPO reduction rules | One mechanism. Completeness principle. |
| `:dual` explicit vs inferred | Explicit assertion, compiler verifies. Can be inferred. | Same pattern as `check` — assert + verify. |
| Syntactic domain distinction | Inferred from syntax: strings=tokens, names=nonterminals, regex=chars | No modal prefix needed. Clean progressive disclosure. |
| Context-sensitivity | Experimental `:context` declaration. Mechanically safe. | Propagator architecture contains the power. Worth exploring. |
| Module export | Grammar rules export with modules. CPA at import time. | Grammar IS part of the module interface. |
| Parameterized grammars | Supported via existing HKT | Grammar is a type-level function. |

---

## 14. Attribute Grammars and Dependent Type Expression (Active Design Thread)

### The Problem

A grammar production needs to express not just STRUCTURE (what to parse) but ATTRIBUTES (what types flow, what constraints hold, what relationships exist between components). In Prolog DCGs, this is natural — `expr(Type)` carries the type as an argument, `{ Goal }` constrains it. The grammar and the type rule are the same language.

In Prologos, we have richer types (dependent types, universes, QTT) but a separate grammar and type language. The challenge: express attribute flow in the grammar without bolting on a second language.

### The Engelfriet-Heyker Equivalence

HR grammars and attribute grammars have exactly the same generative power (Engelfriet & Heyker 1992). Our propagator network already implements attribute grammar evaluation. The elaborator IS an attribute grammar evaluator — synthesized attributes flow up (inferred types), inherited attributes flow down (checking context). PPN Track 4 merges this with parsing: elaboration IS parsing in the type-lattice semiring.

### Design Direction: Common Case + Advanced Case

**Common case (Expression B)**: Pure structure, types inferred from `:target`.

```prologos
grammar when
  | "when" cond:expr body:expr -> (if cond body unit)
  ;; Types fully inferred from if's spec. No annotations needed.
```

**Advanced case (type parameters, Expression A)**: When no `:target`, or when the type flow is non-trivial, type parameters on the grammar nonterminal:

```prologos
grammar expr<T>
  | int-literal _                         : Int
  | a:expr<Int> "+" b:expr<Int>           : Int
  | "if" c:expr<Bool> t:expr<T> e:expr<T> : T
```

**Attribute-rich case (relational constraints, emerging direction)**: For dependent types and complex attribute relationships, `&>` relational constraints embedded in the grammar — the same mechanism as our logic language:

```prologos
grammar match-expr
  | "match" scrut:expr arms:match-arm+
    :target (reduce scrut arms)
    &> all-arms-same-type arms result-type
    &> scrut-type-determines-arms scrut.type arms
```

The `&>` constraints are relational goals fired during elaboration — they constrain attribute flow. The elaborator (Track 4) wires them as propagators.

### The Prolog Connection

In Prolog, attributes are just predicate arguments. Relations constrain them via `{ Goal }`. There's no syntactic distinction between "this is structure" and "this is a type attribute." The elegance: one language for everything.

For Prologos, the `&>` relational constraint offers a similar unification: the grammar says "here's the structure," the `&>` says "here's what must hold." The user writes relationships, not plumbing. This uses our EXISTING relational language infrastructure (`defr`-style constraints).

### Hard Cases (Tests for Any Candidate Syntax)

These are the cases where elegance breaks or shines:

1. **GADT pattern match**: branch type depends on which constructor matched — the scrutinee's constructor REFINES the type in each arm
2. **Session type step**: `send Int . recv Bool . end` — each step constrains the next step's available operations
3. **Dependent pair**: `(x : Nat, Vec x Bool)` — second component's type depends on first component's VALUE
4. **Parameterized grammar**: `list-literal {A}` where element parsing depends on A
5. **Overloaded operator**: `a + b` where the operator dispatches based on a's type (trait resolution during parsing)

### What PPN Track 4 Must Deliver

PPN Track 4's job: make the propagator network serve as the attribute graph for grammar productions.

- Each production creates attribute cells (type, value, constraints)
- The network connects them (synthesized flow up, inherited flow down, cross-domain via bridges)
- Elaboration IS the fixpoint of the attribute graph
- The grammar form DECLARES attributes; Track 4 handles HOW they flow

The hard thing for Track 4 that makes the grammar form easy: the machinery for creating attribute cells, wiring propagators for attribute flow, and computing the fixpoint. The grammar form just declares WHAT — Track 4 handles HOW.

### Status

This thread is ACTIVE and UNRESOLVED. The relational constraint direction (`&>`) is promising but needs iteration. The common case (Expression B — types from target) and fallback (Expression A — type parameters) are settled. The attribute-rich case needs more worked examples through the hard cases above.

Attribute graph grammars (the formal framework where attributes flow along graph edges, not just tree edges) may provide additional theoretical grounding — to be explored.

---

## 15. Open Questions (Remaining)

### A. Code-as-data introspection for grammar forms

Grammar rules AS data means richer introspection than `defmacro` — you can inspect the full multi-view spec, not just pattern→template. What does the introspection API look like? Can a program query "what grammar productions exist for this form?"

### B. Type view scope (deferred to PPN Track 4)

The `:type` view's representation depends on what PPN Track 4 delivers for elaboration-on-network. Track 4 should design with `grammar :type` compilation in mind. Ambition: Track 4 improves and makes more efficient the typing infrastructure overall.

### C. Token-level vs tree-level interaction

When a `:lex` production and a `:parse` production compose (`:lex` produces tokens that `:parse` consumes), how is the interface specified? Is it implicit (`:lex` produces tokens, `:parse` consumes them) or explicit (some bridge declaration)?

### D. Separator patterns and repetition

The `("," a:expr)*` pattern in parameterized grammars — is this a built-in combinator or composed from simpler productions? How does it relate to Track 2D's `child-pattern-split`?

### E. Error messages for grammar violations

When a user's input doesn't match any grammar production, what error does the compiler produce? Can the grammar form specify custom error messages (`:error "expected condition after 'when'"`)? How does this interact with error recovery (PPN Track 5)?

### F. Self-describing serialization as grammar export

The `.pnet` format's Part 1 (grammar rules) = exported `grammar` forms. How does the grammar form's module export interact with the serialization format? Is Part 1 literally the serialized `grammar` declarations?

---

## 15. Next Steps

1. **Deepen remaining open questions** (A-F) through focused discussion
2. **Speculative NTT syntax** for grammar productions — what is the NTT type of a grammar?
3. **Prototype**: compile a small grammar extension to Track 2D DPO spans, end-to-end
4. **Formalize the DCG/Prolog relational interpretation** — grammar as bidirectional relation
5. **Design the `:context` mechanism** for context-sensitive grammars
6. **Connect to PPN Track 4 design** — grammar `:type` compilation target
