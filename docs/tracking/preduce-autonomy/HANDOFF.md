# PReduce Autonomy — Handoff

**Rewritten at the end of every iteration. Read this SECOND (after CHARTER.md) at
the start of every iteration.**

---

## Current state (as of 2026-06-10, interactive pre-loop session)

The loop has NOT yet run, and per the 2026-06-10 owner decision it does NOT run
until Phase A (Tracks 0.1–0.3 design closure) completes interactively. Charter §2
records the amended sequencing.

Done so far (all interactive, with the owner):
- Branch `preduce-autonomy` + worktree `/Users/avanti/dev/projects/prologos-preduce-auto`,
  rebased onto main at `533bfcab` (charter commit now `05a82134`).
- TBGH research layer committed to main (`c27bcc89`) — owner-ratified.
- Grounding-audit staleness fixes committed to main (`533bfcab`).
- Vision grounding audit complete: owner-decision census (8 open points, charter §3),
  drift inventory, prerequisite reality check (tropical-fuel: real, deployed, caveats
  recorded in charter §2), typing-on-network Network Reality Check: PASSES.

## Exact next step

**Interactive Track 0.1 co-design** (main session, owner present — NOT a loop
iteration). Opening agenda per the audit's ranked questions: (a) DEFERRED.md triage
(A.0 leftover); (b) owner-census point 2 — define what "Track 0.1 closure" means
(Master row promises NTT model + six sub-models; the sketch ships neither); then
(c) work census points 3, 5, 6 as the 0.1 sub-models reach them.

## If the loop is started before Phase A completes

Do NOT begin Track 1 implementation — Phase A designs are not locked. The only
loop-eligible work is read-only grounding prep (e.g., per-sub-model code-surface
audits feeding the interactive co-design). When in doubt, halt with a BLOCKED
ledger entry per charter §8.

## Open threads

- Owner-decision census: 8 open points listed in charter §3; TBGH ratification resolved.
- DEFERRED.md triage not yet done (A.0 leftover; fold into 0.1 opening).
- MASTER_ROADMAP: dedicated PReduce rollup section under PRN still to be added
  (noted in Master references, 2026-06-10).
- Main is advancing concurrently (owner's PPN 4C session); rebase this branch onto
  main at each interactive session boundary, and re-verify HEAD-pinned citations after
  each rebase.

## Gate status

Docs-only commits so far; no code changes on this branch; no gates run. Suite state
inherited from main (8380/0 green per `82f22446` commit message).
