# PReduce Autonomy — Handoff

**Rewritten at the end of every iteration. Read this SECOND (after CHARTER.md) at
the start of every iteration.**

---

## Current state (as of 2026-06-10, interactive pre-loop session)

The loop has NOT yet run, and per the 2026-06-10 owner decision it does NOT run
until Phase A (Tracks 0.1–0.3 design closure) completes interactively. Charter §2
records the amended sequencing.

Done so far (all interactive, with the owner):
- Branch `preduce-autonomy` + worktree `/Users/avanti/dev/projects/prologos-preduce-auto`,
  rebased onto main at `533bfcab` (charter commit now `05a82134`).
- TBGH research layer committed to main (`c27bcc89`) — owner-ratified.
- Grounding-audit staleness fixes committed to main (`533bfcab`).
- Vision grounding audit complete: owner-decision census (8 open points, charter §3),
  drift inventory, prerequisite reality check (tropical-fuel: real, deployed, caveats
  recorded in charter §2), typing-on-network Network Reality Check: PASSES.

## Exact next step

**Interactive Track 0.1 co-design, continued** (main session, owner present — NOT a
loop iteration). DONE 2026-06-10: closure semantics decided (decisions-first → coarse
NTT exit gate); SM2 (e-class cell) SETTLED via options panel + owner decisions D2/D5/D7
— see `docs/tracking/2026-06-10_PREDUCE_TRACK01_DESIGN.md` §2 and the ledger entry.
DONE: T5 census (LOW — D.1 §2.10) + SM2 LOCK commit with §2.7 corpus amendments.
NEXT: (a) SM1 (AST PU layout — gates on SM2, now unblocked) or SM3 (rule registry —
inherits SM2's write-target datum + NAC field; NAC acknowledgment is owner-census
point 1, still open); owner picks order. (b) DEFERRED.md triage still pending (A.0
leftover). (c) redefined probe (D5) can be scoped any time — T6. (d) T3/T4/T7 R-lens
targets carried past lock (see D.1 §2.9) — T4 blocks SM2.3 worldview coloring;
T7 couples SM6/Track 0.3.

## If the loop is started before Phase A completes

Do NOT begin Track 1 implementation — Phase A designs are not locked. The only
loop-eligible work is read-only grounding prep (e.g., per-sub-model code-surface
audits feeding the interactive co-design). When in doubt, halt with a BLOCKED
ledger entry per charter §8.

## Open threads

- Owner-decision census: 8 open points listed in charter §3; TBGH ratification resolved.
- DEFERRED.md triage not yet done (A.0 leftover; fold into 0.1 opening).
- MASTER_ROADMAP: dedicated PReduce rollup section under PRN still to be added
  (noted in Master references, 2026-06-10).
- Main is advancing concurrently (owner's PPN 4C session); rebase this branch onto
  main at each interactive session boundary, and re-verify HEAD-pinned citations after
  each rebase.

## Gate status

Docs-only commits so far; no code changes on this branch; no gates run. Suite state
inherited from main (8380/0 green per `82f22446` commit message).
