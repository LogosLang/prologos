# CIU Track 6 — Path Selection **D4** (implementation design over the 2026-07-28 spec)

**Status**: D4 DRAFT — the redesign intake. The normative SURFACE is the spec:
[`docs/research/2026-07-28_path-selection-spec.md`](../research/2026-07-28_path-selection-spec.md)
(v0.1, status-tagged per element; its §10 corpus is the acceptance suite).
This document is the IMPLEMENTATION design over it: supersession mapping,
grounded code reality, the rulings ledger, and the re-planned phase ladder.
**Predecessor**: [`2026-07-26_CIU_T6_PATH_SELECTION_DESIGN.md`](2026-07-26_CIU_T6_PATH_SELECTION_DESIGN.md)
— CLOSED as the record of rounds 1–8b (its PS1–PS15+deltas surface is
superseded per §1.2 below; its P0–P2 implementation record stands).
**Series / Track**: CIU Series → Track 6 · **Date opened**: 2026-07-28 · **Owner**: Zee Larson

**Process note [owner, 2026-07-28]**: one-line tracker rows do not scale. This
document is born with PER-PHASE SECTIONS (§5); the Progress Tracker below
carries status + a pointer only, and every phase's design, audit findings,
rulings, censuses and test delta live in its own section.

| **P0** | **Acceptance corpus** — augment the EXISTING acceptance file with the spec §10 examples + Appendix fixtures; `--check` gated; new forms commented until their phase lands | ✅ | §5.P0 · `e2674208` — 28/28 markers, 0 errors; all 7 fixtures load (layout via `def X`, issue #80 sidestepped); corpus phase-tagged in HEAD notation; carrier pins double as §2.3 docs |
| **P1** | **Lexical seams + the retirement batch** — brace/colon adjacency, keyword-trailing `*`; dot-key + `.*name` + `m[:a]` retirements; `x[]`/`_[sel]`/`.-1` rejections; round-trip pins. Answers spec Q8 | ⬜ | §5.P1 · censuses fresh from `wf_2830f0aa-9a4` |
| **P2** | **Grade-1 core** — `.k`/`.N` access + bare-path extraction, on the landed P2 substrate | ⬜ | §5.P2 · `.N` has an end-to-end head start via `(get expr N)` |
| **P3** | **Blocks** — `x{…}`, projection-by-default, `^` (3 continuations), L4 sort homogeneity, **HONEST NESTING (n-tuples at every n — ruled 2a)**, **STRICT merge** (the §3.6 waypoint) | ⬜ | §5.P3 · Q2 gate RESOLVED (2c: carrier order, thesis-derived) |
| **P4** | **Broadcast ω** — `:s` one-step extent, L1 fusion, **map-generic `:`** (Q1 ✅), `*` flatten, `.*` row-splat, **the 2b HETEROGENEITY SPLIT** (per-position exact over tuples; keys-⋂/types-⋃ over PVec-of-union = NEW row-meet machinery) · **disclose `<`/`:<` (Q5 ✅ v1)** · dyn-tail = support-bounded (4d) | ⬜ | §5.P4 · step-list node (4b) · per-field row-map (4c) |
| **P5** | **Ruling B + factoring** — B2 keywise / B3 same-spine merge, L2 normal form, guided errors printing the factored spelling | ⬜ | §5.P5 · L1–L5 law battery |
| **PX** | **Binder-seam substrate** (carried, surface-independent) — the lambda-adoption hole + the standalone-def seam | ⬜ | §5.PX · position flexible |
| **P6** | **Demand semantics** — RULED STAGED (4a): spec tag amended, X.close gated; lazy-leaf design = own post-v1 phase | ⬜ | §5.P6 |
| **X.close** | **MANDATORY** — bench matrix · DEFERRED triage · doc-truth sweep · memory fold · **Stage-5 PIR** | ⬜ | §5.X · the track does not flip ✅ without the PIR |

*Per `workflow.md`: tests are PER-PHASE (each phase's section states its own
test delta); a behavioural phase shipping +0 tests is INCOMPLETE.*

## §1 The redesign in one page

### §1.1 What the spec is

A theory upgrade, not an amendment. Three commitments the old surface lacked:

1. **The key-sort thesis** (spec §1.1): vectors and Maps are key-valued nodes —
   ordinal keys are *contingent* (selection re-derives them), nominal keys are
   *essential* (selection preserves them unless `^` says otherwise).
2. **Per-step result discipline** (spec §1.2): blocks `x{…}` PROJECT by
   default; `^` DISSOLVES a level (splice); bare paths EXTRACT. The old
   design's single keying rule becomes a per-step choice.
3. **Selection is demand** (spec §1.3): blocks are copattern sets over codata;
   unselected computed leaves are never forced. This ties the feature to the
   coinductive anonymous-record typing that unlocked it.

On top: multiplicity **grades** 1/ω/0|1 (spec §3.1 — interval refinement
points at the QTT semiring), the **equational theory L1–L7** as test material,
**Ruling B** merge with a strict-first monotone waypoint (§3.6), and the
**W1–W4 expressivity walls** each with a designated exit (§6).

### §1.2 Supersession of the settled surface (PS1–PS15 → spec)

| Old ruling | Disposition | Where |
|---|---|---|
| PS1 the law (dot·bracket·`:`·`*`) | **REPLACED** — block = `x{…}` by adjacency; `:s` broadcasts (one step, fused); postfix `*` = flatten; `.*` = row-splat; `^` = the key operator | spec §2.1 |
| PS2 uniform law (`v[…]` selects, `v.0` extracts) | `.N` extraction **survives**; the bracket flip is **CANCELED** — `v[0]` keeps its current working semantics for now [owner 2026-07-28] | §3 ledger |
| PS3 keying = last segment | **REPLACED** — projection-with-ancestry + `^` dissolve | spec §1.2, §3.3 |
| PS4 identities vs positions | **SURVIVES, now derived** from the key-sort thesis | spec §1.1, §3.3 |
| PS5 assembly (keyed→Map, keyless→tuple, mixed=error) | **SURVIVES** verbatim as L4, level-local | spec §3.3 |
| PS6 `^` on the key-generating segment | **GENERALIZED** — one operator, three continuations; mid-path dissolve/splice is NEW | spec §3.4 |
| PS7 collision = static error | **AMENDED to Ruling B** — strict-everywhere is the shippable v1 waypoint (so PS7 *is* the waypoint); errors may later become meanings, never vice versa | spec §3.6 |
| PS8 miss semantics | **SURVIVES** — P2's landed two-tier principle is substrate | landed code |
| PS9 `*` splat / `[*]` | **REPLACED** — `.*` row-splat (block position); bare postfix `*` = flatten one vector layer; `[*]` gone | spec §2.1, §3.5 |
| PS10 dot-only dynamism (`v.i` P4.d) | **SUPERSEDED** — v1 has NO dynamic keys; three-tier design is outlook | spec §7.6 |
| PS11 selector sugar + keyword-projection | **SUPERSEDED/OPEN** — first-class selectors are outlook (§7.5); keyword-projection's direct use is likely SUBSUMED by broadcast (`users:name`); disposition OPEN (§3) | spec §7.5 |
| PS12 retirements | **SURVIVE**, some deepened (`m[:a]`: brackets are no longer selection at all) | §5.P1 |
| PS13 reserved slots | **SUPERSEDED** by the staged-features program (0\|1 grade, `..` as schema-elaborated sugar, observational stratum, bidirectionality, relational reading) | spec §7 |
| PS14 sexp special form | **STILL NEEDED** — the spec does not address sexp mode; carried as an open implementation item | §3 ledger |
| PS15 subjects | **SUPERSEDED** by the typing story: copattern blocks, grade/shape result computation, the §5.3 meet rule, §5.4 row-map | spec §5 |

### §1.3 What landed and stands (nothing unwinds)

- **P0** acceptance file (`examples/2026-07-26-ciu-t6-path-selection.prologos`):
  **AUGMENTED at D4.P0 (`e2674208`) to 28 markers**; they pin P1/P2 substrate and
  stay a regression instrument. The old-syntax §B/§C targets were replaced with
  the phase-tagged spec corpus (see §5.P0).
- **P1** `.{` retirement: what died was `.{`-as-MIXFIX (the `.( )` sibling).
  The spec's mid-path sub-block spelling `server^.{…}` is a DIFFERENT, NEW
  construct — today it reads as a loose `|.|` + `$brace-params` and errors
  end-to-end (`cfg.server.{host port}` → "Bare symbol 'host' not allowed as
  map key"). Its grouping is NEW P1 work — **RULED 3a**: a `dot-lbrace` compound token (§3).
- **P2** (5 slices, `ad75e57a`→`ac89341f`): the two-tier principle IS the
  grade-1 substrate — loud assertive misses (Map key / PVec / List / dynamic
  tuple OOB, both def seams), site 7's projection, the carried-alpha slot,
  `definitely-not-map?`'s positive polarity. The spec's §5.3 meet rule and
  §1.3 demand semantics sit ABOVE this layer, not against it.
- **The P3 mini-audit** (`wf_2830f0aa-9a4`): the token-registry facts,
  retirement censuses (live: dot-key 2 · `.*name` 4 · `m[:kw]` 22), the
  dead-compat-rejects finding, the classifier-error template, and the
  three-layer opener obligation all carry into §5.P1.

---

## §2 Grounded code reality (probe-verified 2026-07-28 @ `89bc321c` unless noted)

### §2.1 The three lexical seams, as they lex TODAY

Spec §2.2 names three juxtaposition-sensitive characters; probed:

| Form | Today's reader output | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `users:0` / `users:name` / `users :name` | ALL → `(users :0)` / `(users :name)` — **no adjacency distinction** | broadcast needs srcloc-adjacency at grouping (the postfix-index positional mechanism is the template, parse-reader.rkt:2441-2450) |
| `x:Int` | `(x :Int)` — annotations are parser-interpreted from the same shape | **the colon seam includes TYPE ANNOTATIONS**, not just keyword literals — the census must cover annotation positions |
| `x{a b}` vs `x {a b}` | BOTH → `(x ($brace-params a b))` — adjacency not distinguished | making adjacency significant changes SPACED `f {…}` call sites — census required before landing |
| `a^b` / `ssl^.enabled^ssl` | glue: `(a^b)` / `(ssl^ ($dot-access enabled^ssl))` | caret continuations split PARSER-side (POL.6 `split-fused-symbol` — ruled, carries) |
| `modules:diags*:msg` | `:diags*` — **`*` glues into the keyword** | flatten needs keyword-trailing-`*` handling |
| `users:{0.userName^}` | `users : ($brace-params …)` — `:{` yields a LONE `:` symbol (no keyword forms) | the broadcast-block form is detectable at grouping via the bare-`:` + adjacency |
| `app-config{database.*}` | `… database \|.\| *` — `.* }` shatters (broadcast recognizer needs ident-continue after `*`) | block-position row-splat needs its own grouping handling; coexists lexically with the `.*name` retirement |

### §2.2 The POL.10 collision — the biggest hidden lift

Spec §1.3 [ADOPTED]: *"unselected computed leaves are never forced."* Today a
`def`'s map literal **whnf-forces its leaf values at commit** (POL.10 snapshot
semantics; the `expr-map-assoc` whnf arm forces `v`). `:date [now]` runs at
definition, not at selection. Demand semantics requires **lazy Map leaves** —
a runtime representation change with its own design (thunked leaves in the
champ? a demand mark? interaction with `.pnet` serialization and the effect
gate). **Staged as its own phase-gate decision (§5.P6), not silently absorbed.**
Until it lands, the corpus fixtures' computed leaves run eagerly — every §10
result is unchanged, only the forcing TIME differs.

### §2.3 The carrier table (printed forms + the spec-notation translation)

The §2.1 grounding was lexical; this is the TYPE/PRINT layer the D5 critique
showed was missing (its "single most important unasked question"). Probed
2026-07-28 @ `2b1b383d`:

| Spec writes | HEAD's carrier + printed form | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `〈T〉` (U+3008) | `[PVec T]` | homogeneous vector |
| n-tuple `〈T₁ T₂〉` | `⟨T₁ T₂⟩` (U+27E8) — a nat-keyed CLOSED row | het `@[…]` literals produce this |
| `〈τ₁ \| τ₂ \| …〉` het vector | **`⟨row₁ row₂ row₃⟩`** — a positional het TUPLE, duplicates un-collapsed, no union | the 2b split's first carrier; PVec-of-union exists only via annotation |
| 1-tuple `〈String〉` | representable (1-field nat-row; runtime `expr-rrb`) but the LITERAL arm collapses `@[x]` to `[PVec T]` | selection mints rows directly — the 2a ruling |
| keyed row `{:k T …}` in selection order | type: **canonically sorted** (`syntax.rkt:749-756`, `equal?`-identity, load-bearing) · value: champ-hash order, key-set-determined | the 2c ruling: carrier order, thesis-derived |
| row-meet (§5.3) | **does not exist** (0 grep hits) | booked as NEW machinery, §5.P4 |
| presence marks + `dyn` tail | `expr-Record (key-domain fields tail)`, `record-field (type presence)` — the S-lens-declared presence lattice | in NEITHER document; §6 declares it; dyn-tail semantics = Batch-4 question |

### §2.4 Standing items the spec does not cover

- **sexp mode** (old PS14): postfix adjacency is WS-only; the sexp special form
  is still an implementation deliverable. The 20 brace-select tests
  (`test-path-expressions.rkt`) remain isolated from WS changes (audit-proven)
  and re-point when the sexp form lands.
- **`v[0]` bracket-postfix**: KEEPS current working semantics for now
  [owner 2026-07-28]. `.N` extraction arrives alongside; both spellings
  extract. Revisit at X.close whether bracket-postfix stays, becomes `get`
  sugar documentation-only, or retires.
- **keyword-projection `map :name users`** (the D.3-B2 replacement): never
  implemented; its direct use is subsumed by `users:name` under map-generic
  broadcast. The HOF/function-value case waits on first-class selectors
  (spec §7.5). **OPEN — owner disposition when P4 lands broadcast.**
- **PX (the binder-seam phase)**: the lambda-adoption hole + the standalone-def
  seam are SURFACE-INDEPENDENT substrate bugs — carried unchanged (§5.PX).

---

## §3 Rulings ledger

**The spec's standing [owner, 2026-07-28]**: the spec was formed OUTSIDE the
project, idealized — it is a **suggestion and guide, not a prescription**;
adaptation to grounded code reality is expected. Where D4 adapts, the
adaptation is recorded here with its reason.

**Adopted [owner, 2026-07-28]:**
- The spec's **[ADOPTED]** elements are normative for v1 *as adapted below*.
- **Q1 = YES**: map-generic `:` (spec §3.2.3 + §5.4 row-map typing). With it:
  path-position `.*` is subsumed; `.*name`'s migration target is **`:name`**.
- **`v[0]` keeps its current working semantics for now** — the PS2 flip is
  canceled; no census-flip of `v[literal]` sites.

**The D5-critique batch rulings [owner, 2026-07-28]** — note: the "D5 critique"
was a 13-agent adversarial workflow (`wf_2cef0199-18a`, 6 lenses +
refute-by-default verifiers) adjudicated conversationally; it has **no
standalone document**. Its surviving, R-lens-verified findings are recorded in
§2.3 (the carrier table), the rulings below, and §8 (risks):
- **Notation = translation, not spec-editing (Batch 1, option b).** The spec
  keeps its idealized notation; the CORPUS FILE is the adaptation layer,
  written in HEAD's printed forms via the §2.3 translation table. §5.P0's
  normativity protocol is refined: divergence in NOTATION is transcription
  (resolved by the table); divergence in RESULT is semantics (resolved by
  ruling). Fixtures normalize to the `def X` implicit-map form (the
  `def X :=` layout defect is filed — **issue #80** + DEFERRED) and carry
  `defn now`/`defn env` stubs with indicative values.
- **2a — HONEST NESTING ADOPTED (spec §3.3 as written).** A keyless block is
  an n-tuple at every n, including n = 1. Owner rationale: implicit splice
  would break the algebraic properties of path selections; **the disclose
  operator `<`/`:<` is DESIGNED as the unwrap remedy** for wanting the bare
  value (a strong signal on spec Q5 — see the open list). Code reality
  AGREES once seen at the right layer: the tuple carrier is a nat-keyed
  closed record (1-field rows representable; runtime rep = `expr-rrb`, the
  same carrier the landed P2 substrate projects from) — only the LITERAL
  inference arm collapses n=1 to PVec, and selection never routes through
  the literal arm. The block constructor mints nat-rows directly.
- **2b — THE HETEROGENEITY SPLIT ADOPTED.** Spec §5.3's single meet rule is
  adapted per-carrier, because HEAD has TWO het carriers:
  · **Het tuple** (`⟨row₁ row₂ …⟩`, positions statically known — what `@[…]`
    literals produce): broadcast projects **per-position, exactly** — no
    meet needed, and a miss errors NAMING THE POSITION. Strictly stronger
    than the spec's rule where it applies.
  · **PVec-of-union** (`[PVec <A|B>]`, length unknown): the spec's rule,
    restated over UNION COMPONENTS — every component must offer the key
    (keys ⋂), result field type = ⋃. NEW machinery, small, booked at §5.P4.
  · **Polarity note (write it down or it becomes a bug)**: the in-tree union
    projection arm is filter-on-miss (optimistic) and is CORRECT for what it
    serves — a single get on one union-typed value, which IS one branch.
    Broadcast projects EVERY element, so all-must-offer is the sound
    polarity there. Two operations, two polarities, no conflict.
- **2c — Q2 DISSOLVED, off the critical path.** Q2-type: CLOSED by landed
  code (type rows canonically sorted — load-bearing for `equal?`-as-row-
  identity, `syntax.rkt:749-756`, not churnable). Q2-value: **carrier-
  determined (champ) order — DERIVED FROM THE SPEC'S OWN KEY-SORT THESIS**,
  not conceded to the implementation: §1.1 says nominal keys' identity
  carries the meaning and their order does not, so selection-order display
  would contradict the spec's foundation. Corpus markers transcribe to champ
  order (deterministic per key set). §5.P3's gate is REMOVED.

**The Batch-3/4 rulings [owner, 2026-07-28 — all as recommended]:**
- **3a — `.{` ADOPTED** as the mid-path sub-block: a `dot-lbrace` compound
  token at the dot band (the `dot-lparen` precedent; prefix-disjoint; P1 owns
  the THREE-layer opener co-update). `.` uniformly means DESCEND.
- **3b — brace adjacency with HEAD-SYMBOL PRECEDENCE**: known reader-form
  heads (`racket{…}`, future language ids) recognized BEFORE the select-block
  rule; spaced `{…}` is never a block. P1 census = three buckets (spaced ·
  adjacent reader-form head · adjacent select-block); the 10 FFI sites +
  `test-foreign-block.rkt` become round-trip pins; guiding diagnostic on
  selecting from a reader-form head.
- **3c — multi-digit `:N`: lean keyword-index token, DECIDED BY PROBE at
  P1's Q8 review** (`{:10 v}` probe + both-modes `:digits` census).
- **3d — colon seam resolved by POSITION**: broadcast is expression-position
  only; annotation colons live in binder/head contexts. P1 census VERIFIES
  the disjointness (Rel T1 typed-var sites `?x:Int` especially).
- **4a — demand semantics STAGED**: spec §1.3 tag amended to
  [ADOPTED — staged]; an X.close gate row added; lazy leaves = own post-v1
  design (§5.P6). The static half (copattern typing never forces) is true at
  v1 regardless.
- **4b — the STEP-LIST NODE**: one selection node family carrying the step
  list (keys · ordinals · broadcast markers · `^` continuations · blocks ·
  disclose). Typing WALKS the steps (per-position tuple exactness, the union
  meet, grade-layer counting structural — L1 fusion becomes a fact, not a
  rewrite). Reduction LOWERS per step onto shipped machinery (`get`,
  `pvec-map`, `map-map-vals`). `expr-broadcast-get` RETIRES with `.*name`
  rather than being repaired. The P3 mini-audit prices the struct before code.
- **4c — row-map typing PER-FIELD in v1**: broadcast bodies are selector
  steps, not arbitrary terms — per-field is cheap; the weakening arrives
  (explicitly) with first-class selectors. The `def := [map-map-vals …]`
  qtt lying-diagnostic (pre-existing) gets a P4 probe.
- **4d — dyn-tail: SUPPORT-BOUNDEDNESS carries** (the old surface's surviving
  D3-M5 principle): closed row → per-field · `(Map K V)` → uniform V→V′ ·
  dyn tail → loud static error naming the remedies (seal / validate /
  annotate).
- **Q5 — DISCLOSE `<` ADOPTED IN v1 [owner]**, bare form, spelled `:<` in
  broadcast composition; lands at P4 (in-step). ⚠ P1 grammar obligation:
  `<` is a WS angle-group opener (the mixfix-swallow family) — `users:<{…}`
  gets a mandatory probe row in Q8.
- **Q4** — `*` stays vector-only in v1 (spec's own answer). **Q6/Q7** — moot
  under P3's strict waypoint; deferred to P5's mini-audit.

**The P1-opening ruling [owner, 2026-07-28]:**
- **THE `.*name` MIGRATION GAP IS ACCEPTED, DELIBERATELY.** Ruling Q1 makes
  `.*name`'s migration target `:name`, which does not land until **P4** — so
  retiring the surface at P1 leaves its live sites broken for three phases.
  The alternative considered and **REJECTED** was migrating those sites to a
  working spelling now (e.g. `[map [fn [r] r.x] …]`). Owner rationale: *"my
  concern with migrating is that we'll also forget to migrate back; at least
  the gap creates noise along the way until it is fixed."* The breakage is
  therefore a deliberate **reminder instrument**, not debt — it is the thing
  that makes P4 unforgettable. Two obligations follow, both on §5.P1:
  (a) the audit must confirm the file(s) carrying those sites are **NOT
  suite- or acceptance-GATED** — accepted noise and a red suite are different
  things, and if they ARE gated the ruling needs revisiting; (b) the breakage
  must be **per-command and non-fatal** (the `d18648f0` precedent: a retired
  form yields a generic per-command error and the file CONTINUES), never the
  raw-Racket-abort shape `.{` had before its retirement.

**Open, GATING (spec §8):**
- **Q8** (the precise lexical grammar) — §5.P1's own DELIVERABLE, reviewed
  with the owner before landing; carries the 3c probe decision + the `:<`
  angle-opener row.
- Keyword-projection disposition (§2.4) — revisit when P4 lands broadcast
  (likely subsumed by `users:name`).

**Carried from the P3 mini-audit [owner, 2026-07-28], still standing:**
- `#:keyword` retires with the `#.:name` twin (`#.name` survives).
- `^` splitting is **P3**-parser-side via POL.6 `split-fused-symbol` — no second
  splitter (P1 does NOT touch `^`; see §5.P1 item 4 and §5.P3).
- `.-1` = classifier-level rejection; negative bracket/`get` payloads = a
  static error at the grouping seat alongside `m[:a]`.
- ~~`.:.`/`.:[` tokens defer to P5~~ — **MOOT**: the new broadcast is bare
  `:s`; no `.:` tokens exist in the surface at all.

---

## §4 Phase sequencing and dependencies

The Progress Tracker (top) carries status; this section carries WHY the order
is what it is.

- **P1 → P2 → P3 are strictly ordered**: tokens must lex before access can
  fold, and access must exist before blocks can contain paths.
- **P4 needs P3**: a broadcast body is a block (`users:{0.userName^}`), so
  block semantics must exist before ω can distribute over them.
- **P5 needs P4**: Ruling B's B3 case is defined over *spine identity*, and a
  spine is only observable once broadcasts exist. P3's STRICT merge is the
  deliberate waypoint in between — every error it raises can become a meaning
  at P5 without breaking a working program (spec §3.6 monotonicity).
- **PX is position-flexible**: surface-independent substrate bugs; it can land
  in any gap, and should land before X.close.
- **P6's DECISION is due at P3** (blocks are what make demand observable);
  its IMPLEMENTATION may land later or post-v1 — see §5.P6 for why it is
  staged rather than absorbed.
- **Gate**: NONE open on the critical path. Spec Q2 was DISSOLVED by ruling 2c
  (carrier order, thesis-derived); the only open question is **Q8 (the lexical
  grammar), which is ANSWERED BY §5.P1** — its own deliverable, not a blocker on
  anything upstream.

## §5 Per-phase sections

### §5.P0 — Acceptance corpus

**✅ LANDED `e2674208` — 28/28 markers, 0 errors** (was 21/21).

**Intent [owner]: AUGMENT the existing acceptance file** —
`examples/2026-07-26-ciu-t6-path-selection.prologos` — with the spec's §10
examples and Appendix fixtures. One file, not two: it already held the P0
charter and its working markers are live P1/P2 substrate regression.

**What landed**:
- **All 7 spec Appendix fixtures load** (`users` · `build` · `regions` ·
  `strings` · `m` · `events` · `tree`). Layout bodies use the `def X`
  implicit-map form — the `def X :=` form hits **issue #80** (filed).
  `now`/`env` stubs carry indicative values (the staged-demand ruling 4a).
- **Fixture convergence**: `app-config` gained `:date [now]` and
  `:url [env "DATABASE_URL"]` per the spec Appendix; its marker was
  re-transcribed.
- **The dead old-bracket-surface targets were REPLACED** with the phase-tagged
  spec corpus in HEAD notation: §B blocks [P3] · §C splat + Ruling B [P4/P5] ·
  §D broadcast [P4] · §I the §10.2–§10.8 corpus (incl. disclose `:<`). §10.6
  transposes and §10.8 recursion stay PERMANENTLY commented with their
  v2/exit pointers.
- **The `v[0]` NOTE was corrected** — the PS2 flip is canceled, so that pin is
  now a MUST-NOT-BREAK regression, not a flip warning.
- **Two fixture outputs double as §2.3 carrier documentation**: `users`
  exhibits the literal-arm 1-tuple collapse (which ruling 2a routes around),
  and `events` pins the het-tuple carrier that the 2b split's first rule
  targets.

**Normativity protocol (refined by ruling, Batch 1)**: the corpus is executable
spec. Divergence between file and spec in **NOTATION** is transcription —
resolved by the §2.3 table. Divergence in **RESULT** is semantics — resolved by
ruling, **never by quietly editing a marker**.

**Still open here**: the spec fixture's computed leaves force EAGERLY until
§5.P6, so the §1.3 demand property is a marker COMMENT, not an assertion, in
v1. Forced values are indicative (spec §10 preamble), so every other §10 result
is unaffected.

**At X.close**: the file promotes to a suite-gated regression test.

**Test delta**: the augmented file + its `--check` gate — **28/28** (from
21/21); records acceptance unchanged at 89/89; zero production code touched.

### §5.P1 — The lexical seams + the retirement batch

**Intent**: everything tokenizer/grouping. Two halves:

**(a) The seams** (spec §2.2 / Q8 — the precise grammar is THIS phase's
deliverable):
1. **`.{` = a `dot-lbrace` COMPOUND TOKEN** (ruling 3a) at the dot band — the
   `dot-lparen` (`.( `) precedent, prefix-disjoint from the audited band
   {rest-89 · dot-key-88 · dot-lparen-87 · broadcast-87 · dot-access-86}.
   `.` uniformly means DESCEND, so `server.{host port}` is descend-then-select.
   ⚠ **This is a NEW OPENER** → the THREE-layer co-update is MANDATORY (frame
   dispatch + langle skip-set + group-items — the `31d27c83` lesson). Today it
   reads as a loose `|.|` + separate `$brace-params` and errors end-to-end.
2. **Brace adjacency**: `x{…}` (no space) = select block vs `{…}` = literal.
   Mechanism: the positional adjacency test (end-pos == start-pos), same as
   postfix-index (parse-reader.rkt:2441-2450). **Census obligation first**:
   every SPACED `f {…}` in the corpus whose meaning must NOT change, and every
   adjacent `x{…}` that currently parses as application-of-literal.
3. **Colon adjacency**: `x:s` broadcast vs `:s` keyword vs `x : T`/`x:Int`
   annotations. Adjacency + a focus-bearing left context selects broadcast.
   **The annotation collision is the sharp edge**: the census must cover every
   fused `ident:Ident` in annotation position (POL.6 territory) before the
   grammar is fixed. `:{` (lone-colon + brace) is the broadcast-block shape —
   detectable at grouping (probe-verified).
4. **Keyword-trailing `*`**: `:diags*` must split into `:diags` + flatten-`*`
   in selector context. (`*` stays in `ident-continue?` generally — the split
   is contextual, not a charset change; the F1b.7g drift rule applies.)
5. `^` is NOT touched here (parser-side split at P3, per the standing ruling).
6. ⚠ **`:<` (disclose, ADOPTED v1 — Q5)**: `<` is a WS **angle-group opener**
   (the mixfix-swallow family). `users:<{…}` gets a **mandatory probe row** in
   the Q8 grammar even though disclose's SEMANTICS land at P4.

**(b) The retirement batch** (carried from the old P3 row, all censuses fresh
from the audit): dot-key `.:name` (2 live) + `#.:name`/`#:keyword` twins ·
broadcast `.*name` (4 live; **migration target now `:name`** per Q1; guiding
classifier errors per the tilde-number template — the ONLY all-paths
diagnostic seat; the compat-path rejects are dead code) · `m[:a]` static error
+ hint (grouping seat) · `x[]`/`_[sel]`/`.-1` rejections (`.-1` at the
classifier; negative payloads at the grouping seat) · round-trip printing pins.

⚠ **The `.*name` gap is ACCEPTED [owner, 2026-07-28 — see §3]**: `:name` lands
at P4, so the live sites break from P1→P4 *on purpose* ("the gap creates noise
along the way until it is fixed"). Do **not** migrate them away. This phase
owes two checks instead: the carrying file must not be suite- or
acceptance-GATED (accepted noise ≠ a red suite — if gated, re-open the ruling),
and the breakage must be per-command and non-fatal per the `d18648f0`
precedent. `expr-broadcast-get` retires WITH the surface (ruling 4b), which
unwinds P2.a's whnf arm + `definitely-not-map?` exemption and their two pins in
`test-path-selection.rkt` — those retire with the node, they are not left red.

**Discipline**: both-modes census per `prologos-syntax.md` § Reader; any new
opener co-updates the THREE layers (frame dispatch + langle skip-set +
group-items — the 31d27c83 lesson); the counting RULE is live-vs-commented.

**Open here**: none blocking once Q8's grammar is drafted — Q8 is answered BY
this phase, reviewed with the owner before landing.

**Mini-audit**: `wf_789e4f0f-f02` (2026-07-28, HEAD-pinned `5c171caa`) — 7
read-only facets + completeness critic; 19 design claims sent for
confirm-or-refute, 9 questions headed by Q8. Findings land in this section.

**Test delta**: reader pins in `test-parse-reader.rkt` (RRB-native API — the
audit's three-API finding standardizes here) + retirement/migration tests in
the track file. Status: ⬜.

### §5.P2 — Grade-1 core

**Intent**: `.k`/`.N` access + bare-path extraction — the spec's grade-1
fragment, on the P2 substrate.

**Grounded head start** (audit + probes): `.N` extraction works END-TO-END
today via a `(get expr N)` fold arm — `expr-get` types PVec + tuple(nat-row) +
Map + List subjects; site 7 projects; the two-tier principle makes misses
loud. The fold target is `get`, NOT `map-get` (probe: map-get's infer has no
PVec leg). `.k` nominal access already works (dot-access → map-get fold).

**Work**: the `.N` recognizer (dot-anchored, priority slot inside the audited
band {rest-89 · dot-lparen-87 · dot-access-86}; digit-required so `.-1` never
matches) · the nat-dot fold arm → `(get expr N)` · chain forms
(`admins.0.name`) · extraction typing = the existing arms (no new nodes
expected — flag if that breaks).

**Test delta**: corpus §10 grade-1 lines uncomment; track-file pins for the
chain forms + `v[0]`-coexistence pins (both spellings extract, per the
ruling). Status: ⬜.

### §5.P3 — Blocks

**Intent**: `x{…}` select block · projection-by-default · `^` three
continuations (parser-side split) · L4 sort homogeneity (level-local) ·
**STRICT merge** (the §3.6 monotone waypoint: ALL duplicate output keys
error, remedies named in the message) · result typing: copattern demand
against the coinductive record type; grades 1-only at this phase.

**The Q2 gate is RESOLVED (ruling 2c)**: type rows canonical (landed),
value order carrier-determined — derived from the key-sort thesis itself
(nominal key order carries no meaning). Result-equality tests transcribe
markers to champ order. **Honest nesting is RULED (2a)**: the block
constructor mints nat-rows directly at every n including n = 1 — the literal
arm's PVec collapse is irrelevant (selection never routes through it); the
disclose operator is the designed unwrap remedy [owner].

**Design questions to settle in this section before code** (each gets a
mini-audit): the block's parse representation (new surf/expr nodes — full
pipeline.md cost, budgeted honestly this time: constructor sites compile
CLEAN cross-module, discovery is patterns+runtime); where `^` splitting binds
(POL.6 splitter at parse of block branches); L4's error seat; the honest-
nesting 1-tuple display.

**Test delta**: corpus §10.1 uncomsments (minus computed-leaf demand
assertions); L4/collision negative pins. Status: ⬜.

### §5.P4 — Broadcast ω

**Intent** — the COMPLETE P4 contract (each item tagged with its ruling):
- `:s` **one-step extent** (spec §3.2.1) · **L1 fusion** — under the step-list
  node (4b) consecutive `:` sharing one spine is a STRUCTURAL FACT of the step
  list, not an elaboration rewrite; the layer count is unfused-ω-steps.
- **map-generic `:`** (Q1 ✅) — keys preserved, values mapped; Specter
  ALL/MAP-VALS collapse into one operator.
- **`*` flatten** — vector layers only in v1 (spec Q4 answer kept).
- **`.*` row-splat** — block position; path position is subsumed by Q1.
- **THE 2b HETEROGENEITY SPLIT** (NOT the spec's single meet rule — see §3):
  · **het tuple** (`⟨row₁ row₂ …⟩`, positions statically known — what `@[…]`
    literals produce, pinned by the `events` fixture): broadcast projects
    **per-position, EXACTLY**; a miss is an error **naming the position**.
    No meet is computed. Strictly stronger than the spec's rule here.
  · **PVec-of-union** (`[PVec <A|B>]`, length unknown — reachable only via
    annotation today): the spec's rule over **union components** — every
    component must offer the key (**keys ⋂**), result field type = **⋃**.
    This is **NEW machinery** (`row-meet` has zero in-tree hits): budget it.
  · ⚠ **POLARITY**: the in-tree union projection arm is filter-on-miss
    (optimistic) and is CORRECT for a single `get` on one union-typed value;
    broadcast projects EVERY element, so **all-must-offer** is the sound
    polarity here. Two operations, two polarities — do not "unify" them.
  · A §10.7-style fixture where components offer the key at DIFFERENT types is
    owed — today's `events` fixture cannot discriminate the two rules.
- **DISCLOSE `<` / `:<`** (Q5 ✅ v1, bare form) — in-step unwrap, so it never
  interacts with broadcast extent. P1 owes its angle-opener probe row.
- **DYN-TAIL = SUPPORT-BOUNDEDNESS** (4d): closed row → per-field ·
  `(Map K V)` → uniform V→V′ · **dyn tail → loud STATIC error** naming the
  remedies (seal / validate / annotate).
- **Row-map typing PER-FIELD** (4c) — broadcast bodies are selector STEPS, not
  arbitrary terms, so per-field precision is cheap; do NOT desugar map-generic
  `:` to `map-map-vals`+lambda (that collapses to constant-W over ⋃ and would
  violate the per-position exactness just ruled). ⚠ Probe the pre-existing
  `def := [map-map-vals …]` → "Multiplicity violation" lying-diagnostic if the
  lowering touches that node.
- **Realized on the STEP-LIST NODE** (4b): typing WALKS the steps; reduction
  LOWERS per step onto shipped machinery (`get`, `pvec-map`, `map-map-vals`).
  **`expr-broadcast-get` RETIRES** with `.*name` — it is not repaired.

**Grounded**: the meet rule's error case is the *typing* side of the P2 loud
tier — the runtime side already errors loudly. Result-shape computation =
grades as shape functors (spec §5.2); ω layers = unfused broadcasts.

**Network posture**: v1 stays zero-propagators (the old §7 posture carries;
the Network Reality Check applies to every P4/P5 commit). The broadcast
NODE-level upgrade (one broadcast propagator/one fire/one merge) remains the
future NTT-modeled track.

**Test delta**: corpus §10.2/§10.4/§10.5/§10.7 uncomment. Status: ⬜.

### §5.P5 — Ruling B + factoring

**Intent**: upgrade the strict waypoint to Ruling B — B2 keywise node merge ·
B3 same-spine pointwise merge (spine = source-directed steps with
`^`-continuations erased; Q7's residuals settle here) · L2 factoring
(`{p:a p:b} → p:{a b}`) as the normal form, with **error messages printing
the factored spelling** (spec: SHOULD) · L3 assoc/comm on disjoint keys ·
Q6 (idempotent self-merge) ruled here.

**Test delta**: corpus §10.3 uncomments; L1–L5 law tests as a dedicated
battery (the equational theory IS test material). Status: ⬜.

### §5.PX — Binder-seam substrate (carried unchanged)

The D3-S10 concrete-codomain lambda-adoption hole
(`[the [List String] [map [fn [x] x] ints]]` accepts silently) + the
standalone-def seam (`def f := [fn …]` / `def add5 := [int+ 5 _]` fail where
the body determines the types). Surface-independent; the old doc's round-6b
capture stands. Position flexible. Status: ⬜.

### §5.P6 — Demand semantics (staging decision + implementation)

The §2.2 collision, staged honestly: **decision by P3** (blocks make demand
observable), implementation possibly later. Options to design against POL.10:
lazy leaf thunks in the champ (rep change; `.pnet` + effect-gate interaction) ·
a demand mark at elaboration (selection-aware forcing) · defer §1.3 to a
named post-v1 phase with the corpus marker documenting the gap. **No option is
adopted here** — this section exists so the lift is visible and priced before
anything claims v1-complete. Status: ⬜.

### §5.X — X.close

Bench matrix (feature microbench + E2E per testing.md — priced against the P2
baseline) · DEFERRED triage · doc-truth sweep (incl. the old doc's banner, the
map tutorial, `prologos-syntax.md`'s selection section) · **the §1.3 demand
GATE (ruling 4a): v1 may not be declared complete without the staged-demand
status re-stated in the PIR and the lazy-leaf phase chartered or explicitly
re-deferred by the owner** · memory fold · **Stage-5 PIR** (the track does not
flip ✅ without it). Status: ⬜.

## §6 SRE lattice lens (the six questions, run against the ADAPTED surface)

1. **Classification**: STRUCTURAL. The result carrier is **row × presence ×
   tail** — a labelled product of per-field VALUE lattices, indexed by a
   support set, a key-domain ∈ {keyword, nat}, presence marks
   (`record-field (type presence)` — the S-lens-declared presence lattice,
   `syntax.rkt:665-687`), and a tail ∈ {closed, dyn}. NEITHER source document
   named presence/tail; this declaration closes that gap.
2. **Algebraic properties**: per-field flat lattices; support = powerset;
   the GRADE set {1, ω} composes by multiplication with ω absorbing — a
   (deliberately tiny) commutative monoid that the spec's interval refinement
   ([1,1]/[0,1]/[0,ω]/[1,ω]) would grow toward the QTT semiring already
   in-tree (m0/m1/mw). v1 claims only the monoid; the semiring alignment is
   OUTLOOK and the lens re-runs when 0|1 arrives.
3. **Bridges**: keyword-selection → source row is the D21 Galois pair
   (projection α, width-subsumption γ) — carried from the old §6. The nat
   edge remains relabelling WITHOUT an adjoint (dense-prefix forbids the
   sparse γ; the old D3-S8 finding stands). NEW: the 2b split adds the
   union-component bridge (flatten-union → per-component record-project,
   all-must-offer polarity).
4. **Composition**: result shapes = grade-interpreted shape functors composed
   along the path (spec §5.2); `*` deletes exactly one vector layer — the one
   deliberate join in an otherwise functorial language (the spec's own
   framing; the lens flags it as the single place associativity of shape
   composition must be test-pinned, L1×L2 interaction).
5. **Primary vs derived**: the SOURCE row is primary; every selection result
   is DERIVED (recomputable). A selection must never become the sole carrier
   of a fact — this is what makes the read-only v1 safe and what the write
   direction (spec §7.7) will have to revisit.
6. **Hasse / parallel decomposition**: N sibling branches of a block are N
   independently-computable projections joined at assembly (the flatten and
   path-keyed shapes remain the all-at-once forms). Under strict merge the
   join is trivially disjoint; Ruling B (P5) makes the join partial — its
   case analysis IS the answer to "where is the join defined."

**OPEN (named for the Batch-4 walkthrough): dyn-tail semantics** — what `.*`
row-splat and map-generic `:` mean over a row whose tail is `dyn` (unknown
support). The old surface's SUPPORT-BOUNDEDNESS principle (D3-M5, survived)
says splat needs a bounded support; `(Map K V)` uniform broadcast needs no
per-field row at all. Ruled in Batch 4.

**NTT posture**: v1 adds zero propagators/cells — ratified twice (predecessor
§7; D3-M2 refutation). The deferral is now NAMED with a TRIGGER (§9 gate row
3): the broadcast-propagator node track opens on X.close perf pressure or
F-row, whichever first, with its NTT model mandatory.

## §8 Risks (carried forward + new — the D5 critique's ⑤)

- **R2 (walker gaps)** — carried: every walker touching the NEW nodes (block,
  `^` continuations, broadcast steps) defaults to the generic
  transparent-struct rebuild (three in-tree templates: the SUB.1 tripwire,
  `re-abstract`, `narrow-subst-bvars`); explicit arms only for binders + hot
  paths, hot arms carrying a differential-oracle contract test.
- **R3 (`.` on QUADRUPLE duty)** — sharpened: `.k` · `.N` (new) · `.*` ·
  bare `.` before `{` (the sub-block seam). The Q8 grammar must state all
  four and their disambiguation order; both-modes census per
  `prologos-syntax.md` § Reader.
- **R4 (a green suite proves nothing for this class)** — carried verbatim:
  failing-test-first for anything walker- or seam-shaped; the D5 critique's
  three live probes (permissive `expr-broadcast-get`, the `:=` layout defect,
  the loose-`.{` shatter) all sat under a green suite.
- **R5 (NEW — carrier drift)**: the spec's idealized carriers vs HEAD's
  (§2.3). Any §10 corpus divergence must be classified NOTATION vs SEMANTICS
  before resolution (ruling Batch 1); a "quick fix" that edits a marker
  without the classification re-opens the D5 blockers.
- **R6 (NEW — pipeline cost honesty)**: new AST nodes pay pipeline.md in
  FULL — including `pnet-serialize` registration + a `PNET_VERSION` bump
  (absent from pipeline.md's own checklist; promote it there at X.close) +
  the D3-M2 item-13 deliberate `#f` typing-propagators registration —
  and constructor-arity breakage compiles CLEAN cross-module (the slice-4
  lesson): discovery is patterns-at-build + constructors-at-runtime.

## §9 Principles gate (two columns — catalogue ‖ challenge)

| Decision | Catalogue (passes?) | Challenge (could it be MORE aligned?) |
|---|---|---|
| Strict merge first (§3.6 waypoint) | Monotone: errors may become meanings, never the reverse. CALM-adjacent staging. | Challenged and KEPT: the alternative (Ruling B at P3) front-loads spine identity before broadcasts exist to have spines. The waypoint is sequencing, not scaffolding — no dual path exists at any moment. |
| `v[0]` retention beside `.N` | Owner-ruled 2026-07-28. | Challenged: is it belt-and-suspenders? NO — two SURFACES over ONE mechanism (`(get expr N)`); the D5 verifier refuted the dual-path framing. Residue: an X.close revisit trigger is named (retire, document as `get` sugar, or keep). |
| Zero-propagator v1 (§5.P4) | Ratified twice (predecessor §7; D3 critique M2 refutation — the Check asks what the track ADDS). | **Challenged and CHANGED**: "the future NTT-modeled track" had no name and no trigger — the ban-"pragmatic" rule demands specificity. Now: **deferred to the broadcast-propagator node track (CIU, post-v1), TRIGGERED by either (a) selection-perf pressure at the X.close bench matrix or (b) F-row landing** — whichever first; the NTT model is mandatory at that opening. |
| Projection-by-default flips by enclosure (spec §1.2: the same path text means block-projection inside `{…}`, extraction outside) | The spec's own per-step discipline; consistent with copattern reading. | Challenged and KEPT with an obligation: this is the surface's largest learnability bet; the corpus MUST pin the pair (`x.a.b` vs `x{a.b}`) side by side so the flip is documented by executable example, and the P3 error for the common confusion (a bare path where a block was meant) names the other spelling. |
| Demand semantics staged (P6) | Honest: the collision is priced, not hidden. | Challenged: is staging an ADOPTED element a "validated-not-deployed" shape? Resolution = Batch-4 ruling: amend the spec tag to [ADOPTED — staged] + an X.close gate row, or commit v1. The gate row is the tripwire either way. |
